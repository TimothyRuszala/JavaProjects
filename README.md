# Java projects

All projects in this folder were completed as assignments in Princeton's COS226 class, which I took in Spring 2018. All of the projects require Princetons alg4.jar to be added to the Java's classpath, and instructions for doing so may be found at the following webpage:

https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/

Even if you don't run the programs, I hope this code will give you a notion of the breadth of my Java programming experience.

**Thanks!**
