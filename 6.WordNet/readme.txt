Programming Assignment 6: WordNet


/******************************************************************************
 *  Describe concisely the data structure(s) you used to store the 
 *  information in synsets.txt. Why did you make this choice?
 *****************************************************************************/
I used two symbol tables. One symbol table had the ids as keys
    and synsets as values, and the other had nouns as keys and every id
    of that word as a value. Both symbol tables were necessary because for
    various methods I needed to search though both ids and words, or find 
    a word's id, or find an id's synset.


/******************************************************************************
 *  Describe concisely the data structure(s) you used to store the 
 *  information in hypernyms.txt. Why did you make this choice?
 *****************************************************************************/
I used a Digraph. The digraph efficiently represents the connections
    between elements in the WordNet.


/******************************************************************************
 *  Describe concisely the algorithm you use in the constructor of
 *  ShortestCommonAncestor to check if the digraph is a rooted DAG.
 *  What is the order of growth of the worst-case running times of
 *  your algorithms as a function of the number of vertices V and the
 *  number of edges E in the digraph?
 *****************************************************************************/

Description: I create a new Topological with the graph. Then I check if the
    Topological's order !== null. ' A Topological can only be made with a
    DAG, and as long as the Topological has been created, the order() method
    will not equal null. Then, to check whether it is rooted or not, I iterate
    through the vertices and check whether there is more than one root, in other
    words, more than one vertex with outdegree of 0.
                                                                           



Order of growth of running time:


/******************************************************************************
 *  Describe concisely your algorithm to compute the shortest common
 *  ancestor in ShortestCommonAncestor. For each method, what is the order of
 *  growth of the worst-case running time as a function of the number of
 *  vertices V and the number of edges E in the digraph? For each method,
 *  what is the order of growth of the best-case running time?
 *
 *  If you use hashing, you should assume the uniform hashing assumption
 *  so that put() and get() take constant time.
 *
 *  Be careful! If you use a BreadthFirstDirectedPaths object, don't
 *  forget to count the time needed to initialize the marked[],
 *  edgeTo[], and distTo[] arrays.
