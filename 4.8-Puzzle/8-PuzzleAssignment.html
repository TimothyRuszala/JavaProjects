<p><b>The problem.</b>
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifteen_puzzle">8-puzzle</a>
is a sliding puzzle
<!--  invented and popularized by Noyes Palmer Chapman in the 1870s. -->
that is played on a 3-by-3 grid with 8 square tiles labeled 1 through 8, plus a blank 
square. The goal is to rearrange the tiles so that they are in row-major order, using
as few moves as possible. 
You are permitted to slide tiles either horizontally or vertically
into the blank square. 
The following diagram
shows a sequence of moves from an <em>initial board</em> (left)
to the <em>goal board</em> (right).

<p><br><b>Board data type.</b>
To begin, create a data type that models an <em>n</em>-by-<em>n</em>
board with sliding tiles.
Implement an immutable data type <code>Board</code> with the following API:

</p><p>


</p><blockquote><pre><b>public class Board {</b>
<b>    public Board(int[][] tiles)            </b><font color="gray">// create a board from an n-by-n array of tiles,</font>
                                           <font color="gray">// where tiles[row][col] = tile at (row, col)</font>
<b>    public String toString()               </b><font color="gray">// string representation of this board</font>
<b>    public int tileAt(int row, int col)    </b><font color="gray">// tile at (row, col) or 0 if blank</font>
<b>    public int size()                      </b><font color="gray">// board size n</font>
<b>    public int hamming()                   </b><font color="gray">// number of tiles out of place</font>
<b>    public int manhattan()                 </b><font color="gray">// sum of Manhattan distances between tiles and goal</font>
<b>    public boolean isGoal()                </b><font color="gray">// is this board the goal board?</font>
<b>    public boolean equals(Object y)        </b><font color="gray">// does this board equal y?</font>
<b>    public Iterable&lt;Board&gt; neighbors()     </b><font color="gray">// all neighboring boards</font>
<b>    public boolean isSolvable()            </b><font color="gray">// is this board solvable?</font>

<b>    public static void main(String[] args) </b><font color="gray">// unit testing (required)</font>
}</pre></blockquote>

<p><em>Constructor.&nbsp;</em>
You may assume that the constructor receives an <em>n</em>-by-<em>n</em> array
containing a permutation of the <em>n</em><sup>2</sup> integers between 0 and <em>n</em><sup>2</sup> − 1,
where 0 represents the blank square.
You may also assume that 2 ≤ <em>n</em> ≤ 32,768.

</p><p><em>String representation.&nbsp;</em>
The <code>toString()</code> method returns a string composed of <em>n</em> + 1 lines.
The first line contains the board size <em>n</em>; the remaining <em>n</em> lines contains
the <em>n</em>-by-<em>n</em> grid of tiles in row-major order,
using 0 to designate the blank square.

</p><p>
</p><center>
<img src="./8-PuzzleAssignment_files/string-representation.png" width="225" alt="String representation">
</center>

<p><em>Tile extraction.&nbsp;</em>
Throw a <code>java.lang.IllegalArgumentException</code> in <code>tileAt()</code> unless
both <code>row</code> and <code>col</code> are between 0 and <em>n</em> − 1.

</p><p><em>Hamming and Manhattan distances.&nbsp;</em>
To measure how close a board is to the goal board, we define two notions of distance.
The <em>Hamming distance</em> betweeen a board and the goal board is 
the number of tiles in the wrong position.
The <em>Manhattan distance</em> between a board and the goal board is
the sum of the Manhattan distances (sum of the vertical and horizontal distance)
from the tiles to their goal positions.

</p><p>

</center>

<p><em>Comparing two boards for equality.&nbsp;</em>
Two boards are equal if they are have the same size and their corresponding tiles are in the same positions.
The <code>equals()</code> method is inherited from <code>java.lang.Object</code>,
so it must obey all of Java’s requirements.

</p><p><em>Neighboring boards.&nbsp;</em>
The <code>neighbors()</code> method returns an iterable containing the neighbors of the board.
Depending on the location of the blank square, a board can have 2, 3, or 4 neighbors.

</p><p>
</p><center>
<img src="./8-PuzzleAssignment_files/neighbors3.png" width="400" alt="Neighboring boards">
</center>

<p><em>Detecting unsolvable boards.&nbsp;</em>
An efficient approach for detecting unsolvable boards is described in the next section.

</p><p><em>Unit testing.&nbsp;</em>
Your <code>main()</code> method must call each public method directly and
help verify that they works as prescribed (e.g., by printing results to standard output).

</p><p><em>Performance requirements.&nbsp;</em>
In the worst case, your implementation must support
<code>size()</code> and <code>tileAt()</code> in constant time;
the constructor, <code>hamming()</code>, <code>manhattan()</code>, <code>isGoal()</code>,
<code>equals()</code>, <code>toString()</code>, and <code>neighbors()</code>
in time proportional to <em>n</em>² (or better);
and
<code>isSolvable()</code> in time proportional to <em>n</em><sup>4</sup> (or better).


</p><p><b>Detecting unsolvable boards.</b>
Not all initial boards can lead to the goal board by a sequence of moves,
including these two:

</p><p></p><center>
<img src="./8-PuzzleAssignment_files/unsolvable.png" width="250" alt="unsolvable slider puzzles">
</center>

<p>Remarkably, we can determine whether a board is solvable
<em>without</em> solving it!
To do so, we count <em>inversions</em>, as described next.

</p><ul>
<p></p><li> <em>Inversions.</em>
Given a board, an <em>inversion</em> is any pair of tiles <em>i</em> and <em>j</em> where
<em>i</em> &lt; <em>j</em> but <em>i</em> appears after <em>j</em> when considering
the board in row-major order (row 0, followed by row 1, and so forth).

<p>
</p><center>
<img src="./8-PuzzleAssignment_files/inversions.png" width="400" alt="inversions in a 3-by-3 board">
</center>


<p></p></li><li> <em>Odd-sized boards.</em>
First, we’ll consider the case when the board size <em>n</em> is an odd integer.
In this case, each move changes the number of inversions by an even number.
Thus, if a board has an odd number of inversions, it is <em>unsolvable</em>
because the goal board has an even number of inversions (zero).

<p>
</p><center>
<img src="./8-PuzzleAssignment_files/inversions1.png" width="600" alt="number of inversions changes by an even amount when n is odd">
</center>

<p>
It turns out that the converse is also true:
if a board has an even number of inversions, then it is <em>solvable</em>.

</p><p>
</p><center>
<img src="./8-PuzzleAssignment_files/inversions2.png" width="600" alt="number of inversions changes by an even amount when n is odd">
</center>

<p>
In summary, when <em>n</em> is odd, an <em>n</em>-by-<em>n</em> board is solvable if and only if
its number of inversions is even.

</p><p></p></li><li> <em>Even-sized boards.</em>
Now, we’ll consider the case when the board size <em>n</em> is an even integer.
In this case, the parity of the number of inversions is not
invariant. However, the parity of the
number of inversions <em>plus</em> 
the row of the blank square (indexed starting at 0) is invariant:
each move changes this sum by an even number.


<p>
</p><center>
<img src="./8-PuzzleAssignment_files/inversions3.png" width="600" alt="number of inversions + row of blank changes by an even amount when n is even">
</center>

<p>
That is, when <em>n</em> is even, an <em>n</em>-by-<em>n</em> board is solvable if and only if
the number of inversions plus the row of the blank square is odd.

</p></li></ul>

<p>
<b>A* search.</b>
Now, we describe a solution to the 8-puzzle problem that illustrates a 
general artificial intelligence methodology known as the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm">A* search algorithm</a>.
We define a <em>search node</em> of the game to be a board, the number
of moves made to reach the board, and the previous search node.
First, insert the initial search node
(the initial board, 0 moves, and a null previous search node) 
into a priority queue. Then,
delete from the priority queue the search node with the minimum priority,
and insert onto the priority queue all neighboring search nodes
(those that can be reached in one move from the dequeued search node).
Repeat this procedure until the search node dequeued corresponds to the goal board.

</p><p>
The efficacy of this approach
hinges on the choice of <em>priority function</em> for a search node. We 
consider two priority functions:

</p><ul>

<li>The <em>Hamming priority function</em>
is the Hamming distance of a board plus 
the number of moves made so far to get to the search node.
Intuitively, a search node with a small number of tiles in the wrong position
is close to the goal, and we prefer a search node if has been reached
using a small number of moves.

<p></p></li><li> The <em>Manhattan priority function</em> is
the Manhattan distance of a board
plus the number of moves made so far to get to the search node.

</li></ul>

<p>
To solve the puzzle from
a given search node on the priority queue, the total number of moves we
need to make (including those already made) is at least its priority,
using either the Hamming or Manhattan priority function. Why?
<!--
(For Hamming priority, this is true because each tile that is out of place
must move at least once to reach its goal position.
For Manhattan priority, this is true because each tile must move
its Manhattan distance from its goal position.
Note that we do not count the blank square when computing the
Hamming or Manhattan priorities.)
-->
Consequently, when the goal board is dequeued, we
have discovered not only a sequence of moves from the
initial board to the goal board, but one that makes the <em>fewest</em> moves. 
(Challenge for the mathematically inclined: prove this fact.)


</p><p><b>Game tree.</b>
One way to view the computation is as a <em>game tree</em>, where each search node
is a node in the game tree and the children of a node correspond to its
neighboring search nodes. The root of the game tree is the initial search node;
the internal nodes have already been processed; the leaf nodes are maintained
in a <em>priority queue</em>; at each step, the A* algorithm removes the node with the smallest
priority from the priority queue and processes it (by adding its children
to both the game tree and the priority queue).

</p><p>
For example, the following diagram illustrates the game tree after each of the 
first three steps of running the A* search algorithm on a 3-by-3 puzzle using the Manhattan priority function.

</center>


<p><br><b>Solver data type.</b>
In this part, you will implement A* search to solve <em>n</em>-by-<em>n</em> slider puzzles.
Create an immutable data type <code>Solver</code> with the following API:


</p><blockquote><pre><b>public class Solver {</b>
<b>    public Solver(Board initial)</b>             <font color="gray">// find a solution to the initial board (using the A* algorithm)</font>
<b>    public int moves()</b>                       <font color="gray">// min number of moves to solve initial board</font>
<b>    public Iterable&lt;Board&gt; solution()</b>        <font color="gray">// sequence of boards in a shortest solution</font>
<b>    public static void main(String[] args)</b>   <font color="gray">// test client (see below)</font> 
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Implementation requirement.&nbsp;</em>
To implement the A* algorithm, 
you must use the
<a href="http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/javadoc/edu/princeton/cs/algs4/MinPQ.html"><code>MinPQ</code></a>
data type for the priority queue.

</p><p><em>Corner case.&nbsp;</em>
Throw a <code>java.lang.IllegalArgumentException</code> in the constructor if the argument is 
<code>null</code>.

</p><p><em>Unsolvable boards.&nbsp;</em>
Throw a <code>java.lang.IllegalArgumentException</code> in the constructor if
the initial board is not solvable.

</p><p><em>Test client.</em>
Your test client should take the name of an input file as a command-line argument
and print the minimum number of moves to solve the puzzle and a corresponding solution.
The input file contains the board size <em>n</em>, followed by the <em>n</em>-by-<em>n</em>
grid of tiles, using 0 to designate the blank square.

</p><p><b>Two optimizations.</b>
To speed up your solver, implement the following two optimizations:

</p><ul>
<p></p><li><em>The critical optimization.</em>
A* search has one annoying feature:
search nodes corresponding to the same board
are enqueued on the priority queue many times
(e.g., the bottom-left search node in the game-tree diagram above).
To reduce unnecessary exploration of useless search nodes,
when considering the neighbors of a search node, don’t enqueue
a neighbor if its board is the same as the board of the
previous search node in the game tree.

<p></p><center>
<img src="./8-PuzzleAssignment_files/critical-optimization.png" width="600" alt="8puzzle critical optimization">
</center>

<p></p></li><li><em>Caching the Manhattan distance.</em>
To avoid recomputing the Manhattan distance of a board 
from scratch each time during various priority-queue operations,
precompute its value in the <code>Board</code> constructor; save it in an instance variable;
and return the saved value as needed.
This <em>caching technique</em> is broadly applicable: consider using it in
any situation where you are recomputing the same quantity many times <em>and</em>
for which computing that quantity is a bottleneck operation.

</li></ul>
